Use Trait Activation to configure sync payloads that you send from Engage Audiences and Journeys to a Destination. Map traits from user profiles to Destinations, configure identifiers to sync, and choose a sync strategy that fits your use cases. 

Trait Activation includes both [Trait Enrichment](/docs/engage/trait-activation/trait-enrichment/) and [ID Sync](/docs/engage/trait-activation/id-sync/). With Trait Enrichment, use custom, SQL, computed, and predictive traits to enrich the data you map to your destinations. Use ID Sync to select identifiers and a sync strategy for each identifier when syncing Engage Audiences to Destinations.

## Use cases 

Trait Enrichment and ID Sync can help you:

- **Increase advertising match rates**: Expand the pool of users you advertise to and increase match rates by using traits and identifiers to find the right customers. 

- **Include more personalized message content**: Include traits in your payload for more up-to-date, accurate data. 

- **Configure how you send identifiers to Destinations**: Send the right identifiers to your destinations. For profiles with multiple identifiers, choose a strategy to select identifiers and send them downstream.
