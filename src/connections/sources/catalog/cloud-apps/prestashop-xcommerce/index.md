[<integration_name>](https://yourintegration.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank‚Äù} provides self-serve predictive analytics for growth marketers, leveraging machine learning to automate audience insights and recommendations.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources) which can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but can also federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

## Getting started

> (delete after reading) Include clear, succinct steps including hyperlinks to where customers can locate the place in your app to enter their Segment writekey.

*1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog){:target="_blank‚Äù} click **Add Source**.*
*2. Search for "<integration_name>" in the Sources Catalog, select <integration_name>, and click **Add Source**.*
*3. On the next screen, give the Source a name configure any other settings.*

*- The name is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse. The name can be anything, but we recommend using something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. SourceName_Prod, SourceName_Staging, SourceName_Dev).*

*4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.*
*5. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI.*
*6. Log in to your <integration_name> account - navigate to Settings > Integrations > Segment Integration and paste the key to connect.*

## Stream

> (delete after reading) Clarify the type of Segment events your integration will send. 

<integration_name> uses our stream Source component to send Segment event data. It uses a server-side (select from `track`, `identify`, `page`, `group`) method(s) to send data to Segment. These events are then available in any destination that accepts server-side events, and available in a schema in your data warehouse, so you can query using SQL.

> (delete after reading) Clarify how your integration includes user identifiers in your event payloads, the example below is from Klaviyo:

The default behavior is for Klaviyo to pass the userId associated with the email recipient as the userId. There are cases in which Klaviyo does not have an associated userId, in which case the email address will be passed in as the anonymousId.

> (delete after reading) For each of the below sections, populate the event and properties that a customer would expect to receive in their downstream tools from your Event Source.

## Events

The table below lists events that <integration_name> sends to Segment. These events appear as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in other Destinations. <integration_name> includes the `userId` if available.

##Identify calls

For every event where there is an identifiable customer (from both the device-mode and cloud-mode) Xcommerce Segment Integration also sends an Identify call. This happens when the customer logs into the storefront, on the last step of the checkout, with the order, and also after purchase with any customer update in Admin Panel.

The following traits are included with an Identify call:

| Property Name              | Description                                                            | Property Type |

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don‚Äôt appear, check the [Event Delivery](/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the <integration_name> support team](mailto:support@<integration_name>.com).
